# ACL Airlines
## Description
This project is a semi-complete airline reservation system. A guest user will be able to sign up, browse through all available flights and start making a reservation. A registered user can do the same (except for signing up) as well as complete making the reservation and pay for them, checking previous bookings, access their profile, change their information and password, viewing specific itineraries, change upcoming reservations and be charged extra/refunded if needed or cancel them and get emails with their up-to-date booking information.
